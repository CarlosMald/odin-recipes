        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>This is a fun twist on a traditional burger, with much of the same flavor characteristics but a slightly crispier texture from the smashed patty.</p>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>1 lb. ground beef, 80-20 or 85-15.</li>
                <li>Lowry's Seasoned Salt and Garlic Salt</li>
                <li>4 slices of cheddar cheese</li>
                <li>4 hamburger buns</li>
            </ul>

        <h3>Directions</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Divide the ground beef into 4 equal portions and shape each into a circular ball shape with your hands.</li>
                <li>Preheat a skillet or griddle over medium-high heat.</li>
                <li>Lightly season the beef balls with the seasoned salt and garlic salt until the top side is evenly covered in seasoning.</li>
                <li>Place each beef portion top-side down onto the skillet to ensure the seasoned side cooks first.</li>
                <li>Season the side facing up with the same proportions of seasoned salt and garlic salt, then using your spatula or a flat utensil, smash the burgers onto the skillet until they are about 1/2 inch thick.</li>
                <li>Cook the burgers for approximately 2-3 minutes on the first side, then flip and cook for an additional 2-3 minutes on the second side. Add a slice of cheddar cheese to each burger during the last minute of cooking to allow it to melt.</li>
                <li>Toast the buns in an oven for 2-3 minutes until lightly browned.</li>
                <li>Assemble the burgers with your preferred toppings and enjoy!</li>
